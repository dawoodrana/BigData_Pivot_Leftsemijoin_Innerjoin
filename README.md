# BigData_Pivot_Leftsemijoin_Innerjoin

# Question 01:
How many instances of each product were sold in each country?
Using Pyspark tool, I firslty "groupby" StockCode, then apply "pivot" to country, and at the end "count" the Quantity

# Question 02: 
Which employees could convince customers to order products?
I used "LEFT SEMI Join" both in SQL and Pyspark

# Question 03:
Which employees could convince most customers to order products?
I used "INNER JOIN" both in SQL and PySpark
